                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mowing your lawn isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about maintaining
                        the health and longevity of your grass. But when is the best time to mow?
                        And how often should you do it? Let’s explore the optimal mowing schedule for a thriving lawn.
                    </p>
                    <h2>When Should You Mow Your Lawn?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The best time to mow your lawn is during the early morning or late afternoon.
                        This avoids the peak heat of the day and allows your lawn to dry out before the evening,
                        preventing fungal growth. It’s important to avoid mowing when your grass is wet,
                        as this can cause uneven cuts and promote disease.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How Often Should You Mow?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Typically, lawns need to be mowed once a week during the growing season (spring to fall).
                        However, the frequency depends on the type of grass and weather conditions. For instance,
                        in the summer heat, you may need to mow more frequently to keep the grass from becoming overgrown.
                        But be careful not to mow too short—this can stress the grass and leave it vulnerable to weeds and pests.
